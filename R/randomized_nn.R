# .shuffle ----
#' Shuffle a Vector If It Has More Than One Element
#'
#' This helper function shuffles a vector only if it contains more than one element.
#' If the input is a single value (length 1), it simply returns it unchanged.
#'
#' @param x A vector to shuffle.
#'
#' @return A shuffled version of the input vector, or the original value if `x` has length 1.
#' @keywords internal
#'
#' @examples
#' .shuffle(c(1, 2, 3))   # Might return c(3, 1, 2)
#' .shuffle(7)            # Returns 7

  if (length(x) > 1) sample(x) else x

# .get_neighbors ----
#' Core Logic for Randomized Neighbor Extraction in the Presence of Repetition (which occurs with high probability for discrete data)
#'
#' This function finds the indices of the first two nearest neighbors for the i-th row in matrix X.
#' To handle duplicate distances (e.g., from repeated points), it groups neighbors based on their distance:
#'   - First group: all neighbors with the smallest non-zero distance (excluding the point itself if the distance is zero)
#'   - Second group: all neighbors with the next smallest distance
#' Both groups are randomly shuffled before selecting the first two overall neighbors.
#'
#' @param i Integer, the index of the i-th observation in X
#' @param dists_mat A matrix of distances between all X_i and X_j
#' @param idxs_mat A matrix of all neighbor indices sorted by their distances for each observation
#' @param n Integer, the number of observations in the random variable X
#'
#' @return A list including a vector of first two groups of neighbors for X_i and a vector of the first two neighbors of X_i
